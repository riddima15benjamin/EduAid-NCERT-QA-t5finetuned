        "question": "Why is reproduction essential for organisms?",
        "answer": "Reproduction is the ability of living organisms to produce a young one similar to itself. It ensures continuity of a species generation after generation. Reproduction introduces variation in the organisms. Useful variations are essential for adaptation and evolution. Therefore, it is essential for organisms."

        "question_code": "1.1.2",
        "question": "Which is a better mode of reproduction sexual or asexual? Why?",
        "answer": "Sexual reproduction is a better mode of reproduction because of the following reasons:\n\n1. **Variation**: Since fusion of gametes from different parents occur during sexual reproduction, genetic recombination takes place causing variations.\n2. **Evolution**: Variation plays a major role in natural selection and evolution.\n3. **Adaptation**: Offspring produced through sexual reproduction adapt better to changing environmental conditions.\n4. **Vigour and Vitality**: Genetic recombination and interaction during sexual reproduction provide vigour and vitality to offspring."
      },

        "question_code": "1.1.3",
        "question": "Why is the offspring formed by asexual reproduction referred to as clone?",
        "answer": "Asexual reproduction is a type of reproduction in which a single individual is capable of producing offspring. These offspring are not only genetically and morphologically similar to one another but also to their parent. Clone is the term given to individuals that are genetically and morphologically identical. Thus, the offspring produced by asexual reproduction are called clones."

      {
        "question_code": "1.1.4",
        "question": "Offsprings formed due to sexual reproduction have better chances of survival. Why? Is this statement always true?",
        "answer": "The offspring obtained from sexual reproduction have better chances of survival because their genetic material is derived from both parents, leading to variations that promote species evolution. This statement is generally true, as sexual reproduction enables offspring to adapt better to changing environmental conditions. Genetic recombination and interaction during sexual reproduction provide vigour and vitality to the offspring."

      {
        "question_code": "1.1.5",
        "question": "How does the progeny formed from asexual reproduction differ from those formed by sexual reproduction?",
        "answer": "Asexual reproduction involves a single parent without the formation and fusion of gametes. It includes only mitotic cell division, resulting in daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent. In contrast, sexual reproduction involves two parents (male and female) and meiotic cell divisions, producing haploid nuclei that, upon fusion, result in genetically diverse offspring."

      {
        "question_code": "1.1.6",
        "question": "Distinguish between asexual and sexual reproduction. Why is vegetative reproduction also considered as a type of asexual reproduction?",
        "answer": "Asexual reproduction:\n- Involves a single parent.\n- Offspring are genetically identical (clones).\n- Occurs via mitotic division.\n\nSexual reproduction:\n- Involves two parents.\n- Offspring show genetic variation.\n- Occurs via meiotic division followed by fertilization.\n\nVegetative reproduction is considered a type of asexual reproduction because vegetative plant parts like rhizome, runner, sucker, tuber, and bulb are capable of producing offspring without the involvement of two parents."

            "answer": "Embryo sac (or female gametophyte) is formed by three successive mitotic divisions that take place in the nucleus of the megaspore. The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides meiotically to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the 2-nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions result in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages of the embryo sac. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte or embryo sac. Six of the eight nuclei are grouped together at micropylar and chalazal ends and form the egg apparatus and antipodals respectively. The large central cell left over with two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical female gametophyte consists of 7 cells with 8 nuclei."

The important steps in the process of decomposition are fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification, and mineralisation. Detritivores (e.g., earthworm) break down detritus into smaller particles. This process is called fragmentation. By the process of leaching, water-soluble inorganic nutrients go down into the soil horizon and get precipitated as unavailable salts. Bacterial and fungal enzymes degrade detritus into simpler inorganic substances. The process is called as catabolism. All the above steps in decomposition operate simultaneously on the detritus. Humification and mineralisation occur during decomposition in the soil. Humification leads to accumulation of a dark coloured amorphous substance called humus that is highly resistant to microbial action and undergoes decomposition at an extremely slow rate. Being colloidal in nature it serves as a reservoir of nutrients. The humus is further degraded by some microbes and release of inorganic nutrients occurs by the process known as mineralisation."

For a limited area like a country, it gives a constant value of 0.1 to 0.2 irrespective of the taxonomic group or region. It remains amazingly similar for all those small regions. On the contrary, for measuring species-area relationship over large areas like the entire continents, the slope of regression values range from 0.6 to 1.2."

They are the most undisturbed forest patches which are often surrounded by highly degraded landscapes. They are found in several parts of India, e.g., Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan (Aravalli), Madhya Pradesh (Sarguja, Bastar), Kerala, Meghalaya. Temples built by tribals are found surrounded by deodar forests in Kumaon region, Jaintias and Khasjas in Meghalaya. Not a single branch is allowed to be cut from these forests. As a result many endemic species which are rare or have become extinct elsewhere can be seen to flourish here. Bishnois of Rajasthan protect Prosopis cineraria and Black Buck religiously. Some water bodies are also held sacred in certain places, e.g., Khecheopalri in Sikkim. Their aquatic flora and fauna are naturally preserved."

Plants play a vital role in the control of floods and soil erosion. Their roots bind the soil particles firmly and in this way they do not allow the topsoil to be drifted away by winds or moving water. Roots of plants also make the soil porous and allow water to go into the soil."

It is due to greater dispersal/more number of surviving individuals. Most animals possess a simple or complex nervous system to control and coordinate various activities. They possess receptors to receive stimuli. Most of their responses are adaptive and ensure their survival in changing environmental conditions. They, therefore, have evolved to reveal much higher species diversity than plants who do not possess a nervous system and respond differently to environmental stimuli."

We are trying to eradicate disease-causing organisms (e.g., poliovirus) from this world to make this world disease-free. Since such micro-organisms are harmful to human society, such an attempt is justified. Further, such micro-organisms are not essential components (producers or decomposers) of any ecosystem, and losing one or a few such organisms would not affect the functioning of the ecosystem."

                                                                      "answer":"Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), play a significant role in trapping heat within the Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the phenomenon of global warming. These gases allow sunlight to enter but prevent the heat from escaping, thus raising the Earth's temperature and leading to climate changes. A catalytic converter, which is installed in vehicles, helps reduce the emission of harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants that contribute to air pollution and smog. The device facilitates chemical reactions that transform these toxic gases into less harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun, although essential for the production of vitamin D, can also cause significant skin damage. Prolonged exposure to UVB radiation can lead to skin burns, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancers, such as melanoma."
